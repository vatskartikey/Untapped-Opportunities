This project focuses on analyzing and presenting the untapped potential of commodities that can be converted into railable shares across various divisions, zones, and the entire Indian Railways network.
The goal is to identify opportunities where non-rail commodities can be shifted to rail transport,thereby increasing efficiency and reducing transportation costs.
